                <p>I am a full stack web development student who is looking to get into the industry full time.
                    I have always been fascinated with computers and technology, so programming seemed like the 
                    natural path to take! Creating this React portfolio has been a challenging but fun experience.
                    I am looking forward to keep on learning about web development so I can eventually make some 
                    really cool applications!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a dedicated learner, and I will do whatever I can to figure out a solution to my problems. Even when I 
                    do not feel the most confident, I still have the perserverance to press forward and remind myself
                    that there is always an answer to be found. After finishing a six month coding bootcamp I 
                    feel like I have learned alot about web dev, but more importantly, I've learned how to use online
                    resources to get myself unstuck. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking to the future, I am very excited to start working in the field and experiencing real work place
                    web development. Once I feel more confident with my skills in Java Script, I would like to learn other langauges
                    like python, and eventually look into game development. My main hobbies are music and video games, so learning how to
                    create a project that could combine all of those elements sounds like an exciting adventure. Thanks for stopping by!
